Demo of Facebook-Post-Predictor from DSCI100.

## About
We attempt to build out a K-nearest neighbour classification model to predict a type of social media posting (ie: photo/video/status/etc.) using data mined from a cosmetic company's facebook page. The model performed mediocrely reporting an accuracy of ~92% due to an unbalanced dataset where videos, links, and statuses made up much less of the total observations in testing. 

The data is collected from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics

## Report
The analysis report is attached [here](https://github.com/calamari99/Facebook-Post-Predictor/blob/main/submission.ipynb).
