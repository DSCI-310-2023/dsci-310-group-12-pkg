## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
library(ggplot2)

data <- read.csv("data.csv")

ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Price)) + 
  geom_point()


## Introduction

In this analysis, we explore the relationship between Year and price using data from a CSV file. We will use the `ggplot2` package to create a scatter plot of the data.
